# Vapor for CloudApp
An unofficial Android client for [CloudApp](https://www.getcloudapp.com/). It utilizes the [public API](http://developer.getcloudapp.com/) to extend their platform to modern android phones. 

Vapor follows a Model-View-Presenter (MVP) architectural pattern and borrows some elements from the [Mosby](http://hannesdorfmann.com/mosby/) library.
